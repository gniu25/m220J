##M220J: MongoDB for Java Developers
This course will teach you how to use MongoDB as the database for a Java application.

You'll play the role of a back-end developer for a Java application, and your job is to implement the application's communication with MongoDB. This includes:

*Reading and writing data
*Using the Aggregation Framework
*Managing the configuration of the database client through the Java driver
*Creating a robust application by handling exceptions and timeouts
**Prerequisites:** We highly recommend taking M001 prior to taking this course. A basic understanding of MongoDB's document model as well as familiarity with Java development environments will help you get the most out of this course.
